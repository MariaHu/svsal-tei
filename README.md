TEI XML files of the project [The School of Salamanca](https://salamanca.school/). Works, Dictionary Articles and more.

The project [The School of Salamanca](https://salamanca.school/) of the Academy of Sciences and Literature | Mainz, in
collaboration with the
[Institute for Philosophy of the Goethe University Frankfurt](http://www.philosophie.uni-frankfurt.de/) and the
[Max Planck Institute for European Legal History](https://www.rg.mpg.de/), establishes a digital collection of sources
and a dictionary of the juridical-political language of the eponymous school.

These files have passed several stages of editorial work and quality assurance. They have been evolving in a private
repository and are available on the website of the project, but once they have arrived here, they are ready to be shared
and forwarded to a long-time archival site and research data repository at [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org/). This
forwarding happens automatically with every TEI file checked in here, and is done with the
[tei2zenodo service](https://gitlab.gwdg.de/rg-mpg-de/tei2zenodo) developed at the MPI for European Legal History.
